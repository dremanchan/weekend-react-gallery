## Description

The goal of this project was to create an image gallery that shows the image description when the photo is clicked and to add a like button to add likes and show them.

Most of this project was done with react.js with a little bit of CSS.

The techniques learned during this project were assigning functions to props in react as well as making server-side axios requests.

I spent approximately 10 hours on this project.
